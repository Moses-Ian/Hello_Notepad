# Hello_Notepad

## Description

A script to run Notepad and start a new file.

This is an exercise to test my ability to write a script that can open Notepad and automatically run tasks by triggering mouse clicks.

## Installation

- Pull the repository
- CD into the repo with CMD or Git Bash
- Run `dotnet run`

## Requirements

- Windows
- .NET already installed

## Usage

If Notepad is not open, this script will open it.

If Notepad is already running, this script will use the running instance.

If Notepad is minimized or hidden behind another window, this script will restore it and bring it to the front.

## Additional Notes

This version of the script only goes as far as clicking on the 'New File' menu item. In another branch, a second version of the script will type text into the text field and save a .txt file to the desktop.
